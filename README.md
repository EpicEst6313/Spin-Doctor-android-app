# Spin-Doctor-android-app
Old spin doctor game that was released on macintosh in the 90s and making it on android.

In this game the user controlls a wand which spins around nodes on a rectangular grid. It can switch nodes when
it is in contact with both nodes and there are many obsticales to overcome. In original game there are 100 levels but i think i might do more
or some sort of auto generated levels
